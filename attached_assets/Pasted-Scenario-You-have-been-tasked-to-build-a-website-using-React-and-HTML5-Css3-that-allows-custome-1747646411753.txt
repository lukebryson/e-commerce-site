Scenario 
You have been tasked to build a website using React and HTML5, Css3 that allows 
customers to:  
➢ Selected a product that are available for purchase into their shopping basket 
➢ Adjust the quantity of a product they order 
➢ Place an order for their basket by providing their customer information 
Install the database 
1- Use the productsJsonServer.json file to install an API that exposes a list of 
product details. 
The API will contain information about the products with the following 
attributes shown below as an example: 
{ 
"id": 1, 
"ProductName": "Chai", 
"UnitPrice": 18, 
"UnitsInStock": 39, 
"Suppliers": [ 
{ 
"CompanyName": "Exotic Liquids" 
} 
] 
} 
The root name is products 
Design the website 
2- Use a JSON server to create an API for the products. 
3- Create a welcome page with some interesting detail about your company! Any 
information will do but you have an opportunity to add some of the interesting 
effects which we discussed during the course. 
4- Create a link on the Welcome page to show a list of products. You will need to 
call your Jason server API to get the list.  Display only the ProductName and 
UnitPrice using a list. You may choose any design you like. You can use 
active links, buttons, icons… beside each product in order to select that 
product. 
5- When a product is selected, it is added to a shopping basket 
Tip: use localStorage to add a Shopping basket Item.  
You may need to create a class for this object.   
6- If the same item is selected the quantity of the item is increased by 1. 
7- Customers should not be able to order more items than we have in stock (see 
the UnitsInStock attribute) 
8- Make sure users are informed of any update to their order. 
9- Create a link to the customer's shopping basket.  
The link should not be active when the shopping basket is empty 
10- When the shopping basket is displayed, allow the customer to increase or 
decrease quantity ordered. Remove the item if the quantity is zero. 
11- Don't forget to display the total basket cost when displaying the basket details. 
12- Create a link on the shopping basket to buy more products. 
13- Create a link on the shopping basket to pay. You will not implement any 
payment.  
14- Shopping basket is cleared when the customer pays for the items. 
Don't forget to adjust the UnitsInStock attribute for each shopping basket item  
15- As an optional step you may ask the customers for their name and address. 
16- As another optional step, you may want to save details of any paid order.
